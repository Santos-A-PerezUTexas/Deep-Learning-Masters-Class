        CNNClassifier. Similar to homework 1, model should return a (B,6) Tensor which represents the logits of the classes. Use convolutions this time.

    A 1D convolution is for time series and it is a WxC filter that slides in the W direction. W represents 
    the time dimension and C represents multivariate dimensions.

    A 2D convolution is for images and it is a HxWxC filter that slides in the H and W directions. 
    C indicates the Channel (RGB) for the first layer, and number of input feature maps for higher layers.

    A 3D convolution is for voxel data and it is a DxHxWxC filter th torch.nn.Conv2d

    I think we can use an example here, assume we have a small image [3(channels),8(height),8(width)]?[3,8,8]
We want to do 5 classifications for each pixel in this image. So it will be: lnput[388]?Output[885],

If we use linear classification, it will be a linear layer: linear[input:3,output:5].

If we use 11conv, it will be  conv2d(in_channel:3,out_channel:5

A convolution layer receives the image (whc) as input, and generates as output an activation map of dimensions w' h' c'.  (NOTICE HOW c disappears - because "The ffc kernel is element-wise multiplied by the input matrix window, and the resulting elements are added together into a single value.")  And we have c' instead because "normally you want to apply not just one single ffc filter, but many different filters. The number of filters you apply is c'."
